A key part of how Linux and Unix systems work is that almost everything is represented as a text file in the system. Almost everything can be *configured* with simple text file.

This means that you may find yourself regularly manipulating text, searching through text and working with text files. There are a lot of options for how to do this! In fact, there are _so many_ options that it can be a bit overwhelming to know what is the right tool for the job.

In this section we'll look at some of the key techniques which can be used to work with text, and demonstrate this with practical examples. In each chapter I'll try to show lots of real world use cases to keep things as applicable to usual tasks as possible.

Hopefully, by the time you have completed this section, you will have a great understanding of the tools available to you and how to apply them to the task at hand.
