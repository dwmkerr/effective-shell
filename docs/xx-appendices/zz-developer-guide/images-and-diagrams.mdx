import Drawio from '@theme/Drawio'

## Images

:::info Not in Use

Ideal Image is not currently enabled as it appears to clash with native Docusaurus lazy-loading.

:::

The [`@docusaurus/plugin-ideal-image`](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-ideal-image) is used to allow lazy loading and zoom of images.

Use the `Image` tag as shown:

```markdown
import Image from '@theme/IdealImage';
<Image img={require('./images/vim-cheatsheet.png')} />
```

This will render an image as shown below:

::: warn Currently Disabled

```
<Image img={require('./images/vim-cheatsheet.png')} />
```

## Diagrams

Render a Draw.io diagram like so:

```
import Drawio from '@theme/Drawio'
import asymmetricEncryption from '!!raw-loader!./images/asymmetric-encryption.drawio';

<Drawio content={asymmetricEncryption} />
```

This would render as below:

import asymmetricEncryption from '!!raw-loader!./images/asymmetric-encryption.drawio';

<Drawio content={asymmetricEncryption} />
