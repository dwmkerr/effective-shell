The contents of this book are primarily written in MDX. Some key concepts to be aware of:

- [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/specification) is the language that most files in the `./doc` folder are written in
- [Commonmark](https://commonmark.org/) is the standard markdown spec that MDX is based on
- [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) is also based on Commonmark
- [Markua](https://leanpub.com/markua/read) is used internally for the Leanpub distribution

Essentially this means that for the book to render properly in Docusaurus, preview nicely in GitHub, and be able to be transformed into a format for use with Leanpub, some specific rules should be followed.

## Links

TODO: links should be explicit e.g.  `00-index.md` rather than `index.md`

## Emphasis

TODO: Use *single stars for italics* and **double stars for bold** - because Markua confusingly uses _single underscores for underline_.

## Asides / Admonitions / Blurbs

TODO

## Markua Tags

TODO

`frontmatter` marks content that is considered part of the introduction or preface. It is numbered in the manuscript with numerals such as *i*, *ii*, *xii*.

`mainmatter` indicates content that is part of the main book, it is numbered with numerals.

`backmatter` todo

## Images

:::info Not in Use

Ideal Image is not currently enabled as it appears to clash with native Docusaurus lazy-loading.

:::

The [`@docusaurus/plugin-ideal-image`](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-ideal-image) is used to allow lazy loading and zoom of images.

Use the `Image` tag as shown:

```markdown
import Image from '@theme/IdealImage';
<Image img={require('./images/vim-cheatsheet.png')} />
```

This will render an image as shown below:

::: warn Currently Disabled

```
<Image img={require('./images/vim-cheatsheet.png')} />
```

## Diagrams

Render a Draw.io diagram like so:

```
import Drawio from '@theme/Drawio'
import asymmetricEncryption from '!!raw-loader!./images/asymmetric-encryption.drawio';

<Drawio content={asymmetricEncryption} />
```

This would render as below:

import asymmetricEncryption from '!!raw-loader!./images/asymmetric-encryption.drawio';

<Drawio content={asymmetricEncryption} />
