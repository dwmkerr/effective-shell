# Good Scripts to write as exercises

- `recent` - a better version of `history`, which deduplicates and sorts based on the most commonly used items
- `quickman` - a quick link to the most common man pages
- `options` - show and interactively toggle options
- `phonetic` - take a sequence of letters/numbers and spell it out using NATO phonetic alphabet
