title: Recording Terminal Sessions
---

There are a couple of techniques that can be useful to record terminal sessions. The first is the [`asciinema`](https://asciinema.org) too. The second is the `script` and `scriptreplay` commands, which can be used to record the actual keystrokes typed and then replay them.

## Asciinema

The [`asciinema`](https://asciinema.org) tool can record the output of terminal sessions. You can see the results in action in pages like [Chapter 33 - Master the Multiplexer](../06-advanced-techniques/33-master-the-multiplexer/index.md).

Some tips for working with `asciinema`:

To record a Tmux session, you will need to start _detached_ from Tmux and then attach. You can do this by hand, simply using `tmux attach`, but this adds some noise to the beginning of the recording. A better way is to use the command below:

```bash
asciinema rec --command "tmux attach [-t session-name]"
```

## Script Recording

Record a shell session by running:

```bash
# Start recording...
script recording.txt

# ...run your commands...

# Finish the recording.
exit
```

Once you have this recording, you can use it to rapidly record an `asciinema` file:

```bash
asciinema rec --command "tmux attach [-t session-name] && scriptreplay recording.txt"
```

It can be helpful to _not_ record a timing file for the keystrokes. If your typing is slow or irregular, or you have to look something up halfway through a script, then having a consistent typing speed provided via a script is better. One way to do this is with the [`scriptreplay_ng`](https://github.com/scoopex/scriptreplay_ng) tool.
