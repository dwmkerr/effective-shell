This page shows the custom components that are available for Effective Shell. These are primarily used to improve the reading experience for code samples.

To add more components to this page, please check the `src/theme/ReactLiveScope/index.js` file, which has been swizzled as per the guide at [Docusaurus - Code Blocks - Interactive code editor](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/code-blocks#interactive-code-editor). Each custom component you want to use must be included in this file.

## AsciinemaPlayer

The `AsciinemaPlayer` component is renders an [`asciinema`](https://asciinema.org/) recording. Note that the recording file must be available to be served to the browser, so it will normally live somewhere in the `static` folder.

First, import the component:

```jsx
import AsciinemaPlayer from '@site/src/components/AsciinemaPlayer/AsciinemaPlayer.tsc';
```

Use the component as below:

```jsx live
<AsciinemaPlayer
    style={{'width': '800px'}}
    src="/casts/483782.cast"
    poster="npt:0:23"
    autoPlay={true}
    preload={true}
/>
```

The bulk of the properties that are exposed are directly from the [`asciinema-player`](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-player) component - this page has a more detailed description of many of the properties listed below. The following properties are exposed:

| Property         | Usage                                                                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src` | The location of the cast file, must be available from the browser. |
| `style` | Any additional CSS styles to apply. |
| `cols` | The number of columns in the player's terminal. |
| `rows` | The number of rows in the player's terminal. |
| `autoPlay` |  Set this option to `true` if playback should start automatically. |
| `preload` | Set this option to `true` if the recording should be preloaded on player's initialization. |
| `loop` | Set this option to either true or a number if playback should be looped. When set to a number (e.g. 3) then the recording will be re-played given number of times and stopped after that. |
| `startAt` |  Start playback at a given time. |
| `speed` |  Playback speed. The value of 2 means 2x faster. |
| `idleTimeLimit` | Limit terminal inactivity to a given number of seconds. |
| `theme` | Terminal color theme. |
| `poster` | Poster (a preview frame) to display until the playback is started. |
| `fit` | Controls the player's fitting (sizing) behaviour inside its container element. |
| `fontSize` | Size of the terminal font. |

## AnnotatedCommand

The `AnnotatedCommand` component is used to create a set of keystrokes, for example for Vim, with a small text annotation beneath. This is useful in Markdown tables showing how Vim commands work, as multiline text in tables is a bit fiddly to work with.

First, import the component:

```jsx
import AnnotatedCommand from '@site/src/components/AnnotatedCommand/AnnotatedCommand.tsc';
```

Use the component as below:

```jsx live
<AnnotatedCommand
  annotation="Go to beginning of buffer, change two words"
>gg2cw</AnnotatedCommand>
```

The following properties are exposed:

| Property         | Usage                                                                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `annotation`           | The text to show beneath the command. |

## Caret

The `Caret` component is useful when showing Vim or Terminal samples where you need to indicate the position of the caret. It can show a block caret, which is the standard for an ASCII terminal, or a line caret, which can be used in things like iTerm to indicate Insert Mode for Vim.

First, import the component:

```jsx
import Caret from '@site/src/components/Caret/Caret.tsx';
```

Use the component as below:

```jsx live
<code className="language-python">
    def search_for_word<Caret caretStyle='block'>(</Caret>word):
</code>
```

The following properties are exposed:

| Property         | Usage                                                                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `caretStyle`           | The style of the cursor, `block` by default, or `line` for an 'insert mode' cursor. |
