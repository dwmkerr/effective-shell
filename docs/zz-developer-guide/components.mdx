title: Components
---

This page shows the custom components that are available for Effective Shell. These are primarily used to improve the reading experience for code samples.

To add more components to this page, please check the `src/theme/ReactLiveScope/index.js` file, which has been swizzled as per the guide at [Docusaurus - Code Blocks - Interactive code editor](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/code-blocks#interactive-code-editor). Each custom component you want to use must be included in this file.

## Caret

The `Caret` component is useful when showing Vim or Terminal samples where you need to indicate the position of the caret. It can show a block caret, which is the standard for an ASCII terminal, or a line caret, which can be used in things like iTerm to indicate Insert Mode for Vim.

First, import the component:

```jsx
import Caret from '@site/src/components/Caret';
```

Use the component as below:

```jsx live
<code className="language-python">
    def search_for_word<Caret caretStyle='block'>(</Caret>word):
</code>
```

The following properties are exposed:

| Property         | Usage                                                                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `caretStyle`           | The style of the cursor, `block` by default, or `line` for an 'insert mode' cursor. |
