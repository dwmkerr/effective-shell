We've now seen many of the core features and some of the more advanced capabilities of the shell. In this part of the book are are going to look at how the shell is configured, different ways a shell can run, and effective ways to manage your shell configuration.

The goal of this part of the book is to equip you with the knowledge and techniques you need to build your own toolkit that you can grow over time, enabling you to manage your shell configuration across many machines, keep track of scripts and functions, and know how to customise the shell to suit the work you are doing.
