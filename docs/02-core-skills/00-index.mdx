This part introduces essential techniques that you'll use again and again in your everyday work. These skills are fundamental to how the shell works and fundamental to using it effectively. Even if you are familiar with the concepts in each chapter, I recommend skimming these sections to make sure there is nothing you have missed.

A solid understanding of these core skills will be useful for later sections. So even though this book is designed to be something you can dip in and out of in any order you choose, it may be worth focusing on this section before moving to later parts.
