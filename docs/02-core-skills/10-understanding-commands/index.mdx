<MigrationInProgress />

In this chapter, we'll take a look at the various different types of shell commands that exist and how this can affect your work. Commands are far more subtle than you might think and in this chapter we'll look at some of the nuances of commands and the practical consequences for your work.

By the end of this chapter, you might even be able to make sense of the horrifying and perfectly syntactically valid code below:

```bash
which $(where $(what $(whence $(whereis who))))
```

## What Are Commands?

This is _really_ important to understand! A _command_ in a shell is something you execute. It might take parameters. Generally it'll have a form like this:

```bash
command param1 param2
```

We've already seen many commands during this series:

```bash
ls              # Show the contents of the current directory
cd ~            # Move to the user's home
cat file.txt    # Output the contents of 'file.txt' to stdout
```

But to be an effective shell user, you must understand that not all commands are created equal. The differences between the types of commands will affect how you use them.

## The Different Types of Commands

There are *four* types of commands in most shells:

1. Executables
2. "Built-Ins" (which we'll just call _builtins_ from now on)
3. Functions
4. Aliases

Each is different and has its own quirks. Let's quickly dig in and see a bit more.

### Executables - Programs

Executables are just files with the 'executable' bit set[^1]. If I execute the `cat` command, the shell will search for an executable named `cat` in my `$PATH`. If it finds it, it will run the program.

```
$ cat file.txt
This is a simple text file
```

What is `$PATH`? `$PATH` is the standard environment variable used to define _where_ the shell should search for programs. If we temporarily _empty_ this variable, the shell won't find the command:

```bash
$ PATH="" cat file.txt
bash: cat: No such file or directory
```

Normally your `$PATH` variable will include the standard locations for Linux programs - folders such as `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/usr/bin` and so on[^2].

If you were to print the variable, you'd see a bunch of paths (they are separated by colons; I've put them on separate lines for readability):

```
/usr/local/bin
/usr/bin
/bin
/usr/sbin
/sbin
```

The shell will start with the _earlier_ locations and move to the later ones. This allows _local_ flavours of tools to be installed for users, which will take precedence over _general_ versions of tools.

There will likely be other locations too - you might see Java folders, package manager folders and so on.

### Executables - Scripts

Imagine we create a text file called `dog` in the local folder that looks like this:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
echo "🐶 woof 🐶"
```

This is a shell script (you've heard this before, but we'll see a _lot_ more of these as we go through the book!). We mentioned that _executables_ are any files which have the _executable_ bit set. Let's actually do this, using the `chmod` (_change file modes_) command:

```bash
$ ls -l dog
-rw-r--r-- 1 dwmkerr staff 32 Oct  8 22:44 dog
$ chmod +x dog
$ ls -l dog
-rwxr-xr-x 1 dwmkerr staff 32 Oct  8 22:44 dog
```

I've used `ls -l dog` to show the file permissions of `dog` before and after the `chmod +x dog`[^3] command. We can see that there are some new `x`'s in the first section. These are saying that the file is now _executable_ by all users.

Now that we have made the file executable we can run this just like any other program - as long as we tell the shell to look for programs in the current directory:

```bash
$ PATH="." dog
🐶 woof 🐶
```

By the way - don't do this! Adding the special `.` directory to the path is generally not a safe or sensible thing to do, this is just a demonstration of how it works. More common would be to run the program by specifying the path to the file, like so:

```bash
$ ./dog
🐶 woof 🐶
```

Another option would just be to move it to a standard location that the shell already checks for programs:

```bash
$ mv dog /usr/local/bin
$ dog
🐶 woof 🐶
```

Executables don't _have_ to be compiled program code, they can be scripts. If a file starts with `#!` (the 'shebang'), then the system will try to run the contents of the file with the program specified in the shebang.

We will look at shebangs in greater detail in a later chapter. But the key takeaway here is that we can also have _executable scripts_ as commands.

### Builtins

OK, so we've seen executables. What about a command like this?

```bash
local V="hello" echo $V
```

You will not find the `local` executable anywhere on your system. It is a _builtin_ - a special command built directly into the shell program.

Builtins are often highly specific to your shell. They might be used for programming (`local` for example is used to declare a locally scoped variable), or they might be for very shell-specific features.

This is where we need to take note. As soon as you are running a builtin, you are potentially using a feature that is specific to _your_ shell, rather than a program that is shared across the system and can be run by _any_ shell.

Trying to programmatically execute `local` as a process will fail - there is no executable with that name; it is purely a shell construct.

So how do we know if a command is a builtin? The preferred method is to use the `type` command:

```bash
$ type local
local is a shell builtin
```

The `type` command (which is _itself_ a builtin!) can tell you the exact type of shell command.

Interestingly, you might be using more builtins than you think. `echo` is a program, but most of the time you are not executing it when you are in a shell:

```bash
$ type -a echo
echo is a shell builtin
echo is /bin/echo
```

By using the `-a` flag on `type` to show _all_ commands that match the name, we see that `echo` is actually both a builtin _and_ a program.

Many simple programs have builtin versions. The shell can execute them much faster.

Some commands are a builtin so that they can function in a sensible manner. For example, `cd` command changes the current directory - if we executed it as a process, it would change only the directory for the `cd` process itself, not the shell, making it much less useful.

Echo is builtin because the shell can run much more quickly by not actually running a program if it has its own built in implementation.

Builtins will vary from shell to shell, but many shells are 'Bash-like' - meaning they will have a set very similar to the Bash builtins, which you can see here:

https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Builtins.html

As should be familiar from [Chapter 5 - Getting Help](../../01-transitioning-to-the-shell/05-getting-help/index.mdx), you can get help for builtins:

```bash
$ man source     # source is a builtin
BUILTIN(1)                BSD General Commands Manual               BUILTIN(1)

NAME
     builtin, !, %, # ...snip...

SYNOPSIS
     builtin [-options] [args ...]
```

However, the manual will _not_ show information on specific builtins, which is a pain. Your shell _might_ have an option to show more details - for example, in Bash you can use `help`:

```bash
$ help source
source: source filename [arguments]
    Read and execute commands from FILENAME and return.  The pathnames
    in $PATH are used to find the directory containing FILENAME.  If any
    ARGUMENTS are supplied, they become the positional parameters when
    FILENAME is executed.
```

But remember: `help` is a builtin; you might not find it in all shells (you won't find it in `zsh`, for example). This highlights again the challenges of builtins.

### Functions

You can define your own shell functions. We will see a lot more of this later, but let's show a quick example for now:

```bash
$ restart-shell () { exec -l $SHELL }
```

This snippet creates a function that restarts the shell (quite useful if you are messing with shell configuration files or think you might have irreversibly goofed up your current session).

We can execute this function just like any command:

```bash
$ restart-shell
```

And running `type` will show us that this is a function:

```bash
$ type restart-shell
restart-shell is a function
restart-shell ()
{
    exec -l $SHELL
}
```

Functions are one of the most powerful shell constructs we will see; they are extremely useful for building sophisticated logic. We're going to see them in a lot more detail later, but for now it is enough to know that they exist, and can run logic, and are run as commands.

### Aliases

An alias is just a shortcut. Type in a certain set of characters, and the shell will replace them with the value defined in the alias.

Some common commands are actually already aliases - for example, in my `zsh` shell, the `ls` command is an alias:

```bash
% type -a ls
ls is an alias for ls -G
ls is /bin/ls
```

I make sure that when I use the `ls` command, the shell always expands it to `ls -G`, which colours the output.

We can quickly define aliases to save on keystrokes. For example:

```bash
$ alias k='kubectl'
```

From this point on, I can use the `k` alias as shorthand for the `kubectl` command.

Aliases are far less sophisticated than functions. Think of them as keystroke savers and nothing more, and you won't go far wrong.

## The Key Takeaways

So we now hopefully have a greater understanding of the variety of shell commands. Not all commands are executables, not all of the commands we _think_ are executables necessarily are, and some commands might be more sophisticated.

As a shell user, the key things to remember are:

1. Executables are programs your system can use; your shell just calls out to them.
2. Builtins are _very_ shell-specific and usually control the shell itself
3. Functions are powerful ways to write logic but will normally be shell-specific.
4. Aliases are conveniences for human operators, but only in the context of an interactive shell.

To find out how a command is implemented, just use the `type -a` command:

```bash
$ type -a cat
cat is /bin/cat
```

## More than You Need to Know

OK, for the masochistic few, you might be wondering about all of the other commands and utilities you may have seen that can tell you about programs and commands:

- `what`
- `whatis`
- `which`
- `whence`
- `where`
- `whereis`
- `command`
- `type`

A _lot_ of these are legacy and should be avoided, but for completeness sake, we'll go through them.

### `what`

`what` reads out special metadata embedded in a program, generally used to identify the version of source code it was built from:

```bash
$ what /bin/ls
/bin/ls
         Copyright (c) 1989, 1993, 1994
        PROGRAM:ls  PROJECT:file_cmds-272.220.1
```

There should be almost no circumstance in which you need to use it in your day-to-day work, but you might come across it if you _meant_ to type `whatis`.

### `whatis`

`whatis` searches a local help database for text. This can be useful in tracking down manual pages:

```bash
$ whatis bash
bash(1)                  - GNU Bourne-Again SHell
bashbug(1)               - report a bug in bash
```

But I can't imagine it will be a regularly used tool by most users.

### `which`

`which` will search your `$PATH` to see whether an executable can be found. With the `-a` flag, it will show all results.

```bash
$ which -a vi
/usr/local/bin/vi
/usr/bin/vi
```

`which` originated in `csh`. It remains on many systems for compatibility but in general should be avoided due to potentially odd behaviour[^4].

## `whence`

`whence` was added to the Korn shell. You are unlikely to use it unless you are on systems using `ksh`. `zsh` also has this command, but it should be avoided and considered non-standard.

```bash
% whence brew
/usr/local/bin/brew
```

### `where`

This is a shell builtin that can provide information on commands, similar to `type`:

```bash
% where ls
ls: aliased to ls -G
/bin/ls
```

However, `type` should be preferred, as it is more standard.

### `whereis`

`whereis` is available on some systems and generally operates the same as `which`, searching paths for an executable:

```bash
% whereis ls
/bin/ls
```

Again, `type` should be preferred for compatibility.

### `command`

`command` is defined in the POSIX standard, so should be expected to be present on most modern systems. Without arguments, it simply executes a command. With the `-v` argument, you get a fairly machine-readable or processable response; with the `-V` argument, you get a more human readable response:

```bash
% command -v ls
alias ls='ls -G'
% command -V ls
ls is an alias for ls -G
```

`command` can be useful in scripts, as we will see in later chapters.

### `type`

`type` is part of the Unix standard and will be present in most modern systems. As we've already seen, it will identify the type of command as well as the location for an executable:

```bash
% type -a ls
ls is an alias for ls -G
ls is /bin/ls
```

This command can also be used to only search for paths:

```bash
% type -p ls
ls is /bin/ls
```

## Summary

In summary, avoid anything that starts with '`w`'! These are legacy commands, generally needed only when working on older Unix machines. `type` or `command`  should be used instead.
