In the first part of this book we look at the shell from the perspective of someone who is familiar with a graphical user interface. We studied how to transition from a GUI to the shell, introducing the 'shell way' of performing tasks which you might have previously performed using a GUI.

In this section, we'll look at core shell skills. These skills are fundamental to how the shell works, and fundamental to using it effectively. Even if you are familiar with the concepts in each chapter, I would still recommend skimming these sections to make sure there is nothing you have missed.

A solid understanding of these core skills will be useful for later sections. So even though this book is designed to be something you can dip and dip out of, in any order you choose, it may be worth focusing on this section before moving to later sections.
