## Effective Shell 
#### By Dave Kerr <br>Edited and Revised by Josh Timmons

This book is for anyone who is interested in computing, and wants to learn more about the exciting, but sometimes daunting, world of _The Shell!_

For the newcomer, you'll learn what a shell is, how to use it on your system, and how to become more effective everyday by integrating the shell into your work.
For the experienced professional, there are chapters which go into advanced topics and introduce real-world ways to be more effective with your usage.

The goal of this book is to offer a collection of small, self-contained tutorials on how to use the shell more effectively.
You can go through it sequentially, or pick and choose the sections which seem most interesting.

This book is also open source! The code is on [https://github.com/josh-59/effective-shell](https://github.com/josh-59/effective-shell). Feel free to use the 'Comments' section at the bottom of each page to discuss the content, or even [open a pull request](https://github.com/josh-59/effective-shell/pulls) to propose changes.
