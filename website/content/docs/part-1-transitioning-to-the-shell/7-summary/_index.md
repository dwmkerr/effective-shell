# Summary

In this section we learnt:

- That this book is for IT professionals, hobbyists or anyone who wants to learn more about how to work with computers
- What the shell is, and why we might want to use it
- How to open the shell programs for Windows, Mac and Linux which are installed by default
- How to configure the shells for Windows or Mac to behave in a Linux-like way to allow us to follow on with the rest of the book

We introduced the following commands:

- `cd` - which _changes directory_
- `pwd` - which _prints the current working directory_
- `ls` - which _lists_ the contents of a directory
- `echo` - which writes text to the screen
- `open` - which will open a file or folder

We also briefly introduced _variables_, which are special values which start with the dollar symbol, such as `$HOME` which stores the user's home directory. We saw that each directory contains two special directories - `..` which represents the _parent directory_, and `.` which represents the _current directory_.

With these tasks complete we can now move onto the next section.
