# Chapter 1 - What is the Shell?

When we talk about "The Shell", we're referring to a text-based interface which is used to control a computer.
A shell takes in typed commands and executes them. 

Here's what it looks like on Windows:

</a>

And here's what it looks like on a Mac:

</a>

And here's what it looks like on Fedora, a popular Linux distribution:

</a>


It might come as a surprise that _many_ technical computer users (programmers, data scientists, systems administrators etc) spend a lot of time using an interface which looks like it's from the sixties.
Why would someone choose to use such an interface?

- Typing is _fast_: A skilled shell user can manipulate a system at dazzling speeds just using a keyboard. Typing commands is generally _much_ faster than exploring through user interfaces with a mouse
- Shells are _programmable_: Users will often being programming as they work in a shell, creating scripts to automate time-consuming or repetitive processes
- Shells are _portable_: A shell can be used to interface to almost any type of computer, from a mainframe to a Raspberry Pi, in a very similar way.
