## Work in Progress!

If you have landed here, then most likely you have clicked a link to a chapter which has not yet been completed. Sorry about that!

I'm trying to get a few chapters published each week, check back regularly to see if the section you are looking for is completed.

You can also sign up with the form below to be notified when I publish new chapters (I don't use this for anything beyond notifications of updates to the book and don't share any details).

```
<!-- Begin Mailchimp Signup Form -->
