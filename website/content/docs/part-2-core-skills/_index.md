## Part 2 - Core Skill

In the first part, we looked at how to get the shell up and running on your system. 
In this section, we'll study how to transition from a graphical interface to a text-based interface.  
The skills taught here are fundamental to how the shell works, and fundamental to using it effectively. 
Even if you are familiar with the concepts in each chapter, I would still recommend skimming these sections to make sure there is nothing you have missed.

First, we'll take a look at how to navigate your system using the shell, and how to get information on files and folders within the system.
