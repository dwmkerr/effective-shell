## Part 3 - Manipulating Text and Streams

The next major skill an effective terminal user ought to know is how to manipulate text.
In this section, we'll look at some of the key techniques which can be used to work with text, and demonstrate them with practical examples. 
In each chapter I'll try to show lots of real world use cases to keep things as applicable to usual tasks as possible.

Hopefully, by the time you have completed this section, you will have a great understanding of the tools available to you and how to apply them to the task at hand.
