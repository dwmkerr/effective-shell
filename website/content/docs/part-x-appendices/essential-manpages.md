### The Most Important Manpages

As an appendix, or printed reference, list of the top ten manpages?

- `man re_pattern` - basic and extended regex patterns
- `man test` is an excellent way to quickly check common tests (existence of a file etc)
- `man set` is super useful when checking options like `set -ex` in scripts
- `man re_format`
- `man getopt`
- `man XXX` show signal commands (`Ctrl+V` etc)
- `man bash` search for `ARITHMETIC\ EVALUATION` to find how arithmetic operators work in bash

- `man bash` search `GRAMMAR` for pipelines, if statements, conditionals, loops, lists and so on
