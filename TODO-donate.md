No need for leanpub - it generates a manu and I have that
However, markdown to manu could easily generate text for leanpub, most of leanpub is just markdown, except for 

{aside category='warning'}
whatever
{/aside}

However, why bother with this, if it's online reading people will want, just create a donate page and offer a PDF download for minimum donations.

- Donation could be a sliding bar, showing how much the author gets
- Create a donate page, suggested minimum and maximum
- track this as a goal in GA
- share the book more widely
- integrate 'donate' links or a 'donate' popup some time
- collect feedback when donating
