# Typography Rules

## Em-Dashes

The book uses em-dashes (`—`) for parenthetical statements. Preserve as the actual Unicode character.

**Correct:**
```markdown
Performing basic operations—such as navigating—can be daunting.
```

**Incorrect:**
```markdown
Performing basic operations---such as navigating---can be daunting.
Performing basic operations--such as navigating--can be daunting.
```

### Common Em-Dash Patterns

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Parenthetical | `text—inserted thought—continues` |
| Attribution | `—Author Name` |
| Interruption | `I was going to—` |
| Emphasis | `the answer—finally—arrived` |

## En-Dashes

Use en-dashes (`–`) for ranges. Less common in the book.

```markdown
Pages 10–20
Years 2020–2024
```

## Quotation Marks

Use straight quotes, not curly/smart quotes.

**Correct:**
```markdown
The "working directory" is where commands run.
It's called 'pushd' for "push directory".
```

**Incorrect:**
```markdown
The "working directory" is where commands run.
It's called 'pushd' for "push directory".
```

## Ellipsis

Use three periods, not Unicode ellipsis character.

**Correct:**
```markdown
drwxr-xr-x 2 dwmkerr dwmkerr 4096 Apr 2 19:18 Desktop
...
```

**Incorrect:**
```markdown
drwxr-xr-x 2 dwmkerr dwmkerr 4096 Apr 2 19:18 Desktop
…
```

## Apostrophes

Use straight apostrophes.

**Correct:** `it's`, `don't`, `user's`
**Incorrect:** `it's`, `don't`, `user's`
