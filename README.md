## Introduction

This repository contains all of the content for the [Effective Shell](https://effective-shell.com/) online book.

The `effective-shell-playground` folder which has all of the samples can be downloaded from [https://effective-shell.com/downloads/effective-shell-playground.zip](https://effective-shell.com/downloads/effective-shell-playground.zip)

## Improvements

- [ ] Add `tree` to the Chapter 'Moving Around'.
- [ ] Getting Help: `help`
- [ ] `man test` is an excellent way to quickly check common tests (existence of a file etc)
- [ ] `man set` is super useful when checking options like `set -ex` in scripts
- [ ] For the 'Getting Help' page, include `whatis` and `whereis`.
- [ ] A good example of commands/binaries challenges with dotfiles is shown when trying to use `nvm` in a makefile (`nvm` is a sourced command, so not present in non-interactive shells)

## Sharing

I tend to use the following hashtags when sharing:

```
#effective-shell #shell #linux #bash #devops #hacking #coding #programming
```

## The Pitch

This is _not_ a book about Shell Programming. There are many excellent Shell Programming books (see below). This is about general terminal and shell skills which will make you effective with many day to day tasks. Some shell programming is covered, but this is primary a book about how to work more effectively with command line interfaces and shells in general.

Possible titles:

**Darkscreen**: 30 ways to use shells and terminals to be more effective developer or operator.
**Effective Shell**: 30 ways to use shells and terminals to be more effective.

### Publishers

Books which I've found exciting, which I think could be examples of how this book might be developed:

- [Effective C++: 55 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Specific-Improve-Programs-Designs/dp/0321334876)
- [Effective Modern C++: 42 Specific Ways to Improve Your Use of C++11 and C++14](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Modern-Specific-Ways-Improve/dp/1491903996)
- [3D Graphics Programming: Games & Beyond](https://www.amazon.com/3D-Graphics-Programming-Games-Beyond/dp/0672319292/)
- [How Linux Works, 2nd Edition](https://nostarch.com/howlinuxworks2)

## The Website

The content in this repository is built into a static site available at [effective-shell.com](https://effective-shell). This is done using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

This section contains information on how to built, use and edit the site. To help you quickly edit the site, some tips are below:

- The main _content_ is at [website/content/docs/](website/content/docs/)
- The menu structure is defined at [website/content/menu/index.md](website/content/menu/index.md).

### Building the Website

This website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It is very easy to setup and run locally.

To setup dependencies, run:

```sh
make setup
```

To serve the site locally, run:

```sh
make serve
```

To build the site, run:

```sh
make build
```

The built site is generated at `./website/public`.

Note that the [`effective-shell-playground`](./effective-shell-playground) folder is automatically zipped up and added to the website, meaning it can be downloaded directly from:

```
https://effective-shell.com/downloads/effective-shell-playground.zip
```

### Updating the Theme

The site uses the [github.com/dwmkerr/hugo-book](https://github.com/dwmkerr/hugo-book) theme, which is a fork of [alex-shpak](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book).
