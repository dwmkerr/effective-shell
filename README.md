## Introduction

This repository contains all of the content for the [Effective Shell](https://effective-shell.com/) online book.

## Installing the Samples

You can install the samples into your `~/effective-shell` folder with this command:

```sh
curl effective.sh | sh
```

Or can also manually download them using from any of these locations:

- [https://effective-shell.com/downloads/effective-shell-playground.zip](https://effective-shell.com/downloads/effective-shell-playground.zip)
- [https://effective-shell.com/downloads/effective-shell-playground.tar.gz](https://effective-shell.com/downloads/effective-shell-playground.tar.gz)

## The Website

The content in this repository is built into a static site available at [effective-shell.com](https://effective-shell.com). This is done using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

This section contains information on how to built, use and edit the site. To help you quickly edit the site, some tips are below:

- The main _content_ is at [website/content/docs/](website/content/docs/)
- The menu structure is defined at [website/content/menu/index.md](website/content/menu/index.md).

### Building the Website

This website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It is very easy to setup and run locally.

To setup dependencies, run:

```sh
make setup
```

To serve the site locally, run:

```sh
make serve
```

To build the site, run:

```sh
make build
```

The built site is generated at `./website/public`.

Note that the [`effective-shell-playground`](./effective-shell-playground) folder is automatically zipped up and added to the website, meaning it can be downloaded directly from:

```
https://effective-shell.com/downloads/effective-shell-playground.zip
```

### Updating the Theme

The site uses the [github.com/dwmkerr/hugo-book](https://github.com/dwmkerr/hugo-book) theme, which is a fork of [alex-shpak](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book).

## Versioning

The version of the site and the code is defined in the [`version.txt`](./version.txt) file. This makes it reasonably straightforward to script actions which require the version.

Releasing in managed via [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) in the [`release-please.yaml`](./.github/workflows/release-please.yaml) workflow file.
