In this section we&#x27;ll introduce just what the shell is, who this book is useful for, and what you can expect to learn.</p><p>We&#x27;ll also look at how to set your computer up so that you can follow along with the examples. We&#x27;ll finish by demonstrating a few basic skills so that you can learn to move around in the shell and get started with the rest of the book.</p><p>If you are already comfortable with running a shell, know what <em>Bash</em> is, and know how to run basic commands like <code>ls</code> and <code>cd</code>, then you can completely skip this section.</p><p>If you are already comfortable with running a shell, know what <code>bash</code> is, and know how to run basic commands like <code>ls</code> and <code>cd</code>, are familiar with terms like <em>command</em> and <em>parameter</em> then you can skip this section. You could also just review the <a href="#summary">Summary</a> to make sure that you are comfortable with the material which has been introduced and then move onto the next section.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="what-is-the-shell">What is the Shell?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-the-shell" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>If you don&#x27;t know what the shell is, then this is the place to start!</p><p>When we talk about &quot;The Shell&quot;, we&#x27;re normally referring to the simple, text-based interface which is used to control a computer or a program.</p><p>Here&#x27;s what the shell looks like on Windows:</p><img src="/assets/images/windows-shell-ade4a68eb3fc37c74d58144f35e128ce.png" width="800px"><p>And here&#x27;s what it looks like on a Mac:</p><img src="/assets/images/mac-shell-e2a527be5dd0a060b69e863b34e3573a.png" width="800px"><p>And here&#x27;s what it looks like on Fedora, a popular Linux distribution:</p><img src="/assets/images/linux-shell-5ef723374126e0ea4c3c54483987a629.png" width="800px"><p>When we are talking about the shell in this book, we&#x27;re talking about the simple program which can be used to operate the computer using this text based interface.</p><p>Why would you want to do this? There are a few reasons!</p><p>Firstly, using the shell can help you learn more about the internals of how your computer can work. This can be really helpful if you are technology professional or work with computers.</p><p>Secondly, there are some scenarios where you <em>have</em> to use a shell. Not every program or system can be operated with a <em>Graphical User Interface</em>, which is the visual point-and-click interface you are probably using now. Some lower-level programs do not have such interfaces, and many computers do not either.</p><p>Finally, there are some scenarios where it can be <em>more efficient</em> to use the shell. Operations which might be time consuming or repetitive to perform using the user interface might be much faster to perform in a shell. You can also write <em>shell scripts</em> to automate these kinds of operations.</p><p>In the next section you&#x27;ll learn how to startup the shell on your computer. Once this is done you are ready to continue with the book.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="opening-the-shell">Opening the Shell<a class="hash-link" href="#opening-the-shell" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Now let&#x27;s actually learn how to open the shell on your computer.</p><p>Once we&#x27;ve done this, we might need to make some configuration changes so that we get it to behave in a way which as consistent with <em>other</em> shells as possible - we&#x27;ll get to that in the next chapter.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="microsoft-windows">Microsoft Windows<a class="hash-link" href="#microsoft-windows" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>There are a number of shell programs on Microsoft Windows. We&#x27;ll be using the basic shell which is pre-installed, which is called the &quot;Command Prompt&quot;.</p><p>To open the command prompt, start by clicking the start button on the bottom left hand side of the screen, and type <code>command prompt</code>. Open the Command Prompt program:</p><img alt="Screenshot: Search for Command Prompt" src="/assets/images/windows-search-command-prompt-3649f5245909e5d709626e6ae028234a.png" width="800px"><p>Once the program has opened, type <code>whoami</code> then hit the Return key. The <code>whoami</code> program will show the username of the logged in user:</p><img alt="Screenshot: whoami on Windows" src="/assets/images/windows-shell-whoami-ade4a68eb3fc37c74d58144f35e128ce.png" width="800px"><p>That&#x27;s it! We&#x27;ve still got some configuration to do to make this shell behave more like a Linux shell, which this book uses as the standard, but we&#x27;ll come to that in the next section.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="macos">MacOS<a class="hash-link" href="#macos" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>If you are using a Mac, then you just need to run the &quot;Terminal&quot; program to open your shell. Hold down the Command Key and press Space, then type <code>terminal</code>. Open the terminal program which is shown:</p><img alt="Screenshot: Search for Terminal" src="/assets/images/osx-search-terminal-7ac82426f49389bc7f8018a88258fbc5.png" width="800px"><p>Once the program has opened, type <code>whoami</code> then hit the Return key. The <code>whoami</code> program will show the username of the logged in user:</p><img alt="Screenshot: whoami on OSX" src="/assets/images/osx-shell-whoami-c8395feac9a865fec59e4cb9ee037615.png" width="800px"><p>That&#x27;s it! In the next section we&#x27;ll make some minor configuration changes to keep things consistent with the samples in the book.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="linux--unix">Linux / Unix<a class="hash-link" href="#linux--unix" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>If you are using a Linux or Unix system, I&#x27;ll assume that you are familiar enough with it to open a shell. Which terminal you use should not affect how you use this book, but for consistencies sake be aware that most of the examples are assuming that the user is using Bash version 5.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="configuring-the-shell">Configuring the Shell<a class="hash-link" href="#configuring-the-shell" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Shells can vary enormously between different systems. In general, Linux systems tend to use the &quot;Bash&quot; shell and require little configuration. Apple&#x27;s MacOS operating system is actually based on BSD Unix, and under the hood is somewhat different to most Linux systems. Microsoft Windows is a completely unrelated operating system to either Linux or Unix and operates in a fundamentally different way both of them.</p><p>In this book, we assume that you are using a &quot;Linux-like&quot; system, something which operates like a modern Linux distribution. This is a deliberate choice. If you become comfortable using a Linux-like shell, you can generally apply the techniques we&#x27;ll show to MacOS with no difficulties. For Windows, the techniques are not necessarily transferable immediately, but still valuable to know. Windows is actually being updated at the time of writing to provide a Linux-like shell interface as part of the core operating system (this is known as the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Subsystem Linux</a>. As time progresses it will be easier to run commands using the techniques in this book natively, but for now we&#x27;ll have to tweak a few things.</p><p>In this section we&#x27;ll make sure that we are running with a setup which is close to Linux, and aim to set the latest version of our shell to the popular &quot;Bash&quot; program. If you are familiar with Bash but prefer to use another shell, that is fine, most of the book will work with any modern shell. However, if you are not sure what shell you should be using, I would recommend you follow the guides below to setup the most popular shell at its latest version.</p><p>Once this is done then we are ready to get into the book properly!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="microsoft-windows-1">Microsoft Windows<a class="hash-link" href="#microsoft-windows-1" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Windows is not anything like Linux under the hood. So to get a shell working, we have three options:</p><ol><li>Use a tool which provides common Linux tools which have been written to work with Windows</li><li>Use a &quot;virtual machine&quot; running Linux</li><li>Use the Windows Subsystem for Linux</li></ol><p>The first option is the best if you want to actually be able to work with the files on your computer quickly and easily day to day.</p><p>The second option is best if you want to be able to experiment with the shell, but keep it completely separate from your main computer and its files.</p><p>The final option is best if you are a power user or expert who wants to use the latest WSL features and build the skills with the platform as soon as possible.</p><p>We&#x27;ll go through all options here.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="option-1-install-linux-tools">Option 1: Install Linux Tools<a class="hash-link" href="#option-1-install-linux-tools" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>This is probably the easiest option and the one I would recommend for most user. It will let you run something like a Linux shell when you choose to, but not get in your way during day-to-day usage of your computer.</p><p>To get a Linux-like experience on a Windows machine, we&#x27;ll install <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cygwin</a>. Cygwin provides a large set of programs which are generally available on Linux systems, which are designed to work on Windows.</p><p>Download the Cygwin installer and start the installation process. You should see something like this:</p><img alt="Screenshot: Cygwin Setup" src="/assets/images/cygwin-1-c2222807ad8531efa8f904ebd7d47ac5.png" width="400px"><p>Start the installation and tell it to install from the internet (the default option):</p><img alt="Screenshot: Cygwin Setup" src="/assets/images/cygwin-2-9a538f448ea5789e7fbdcaecb5c85c88.png" width="400px"><p>Install for all users in the default location. It is also fine to change the options if you prefer:</p><img alt="Screenshot: Cygwin Setup" src="/assets/images/cygwin-3-089db6ba17fc27105f49bfeb2b32394f.png" width="400px"><p>Cygwin will ask you where to install downloaded packages, whether a proxy is needed, and what download sites to use. Leave these options at their default unless you know what you are doing and why you&#x27;d need to change them. It will then start downloading. Once it has downloaded the list of available packages to install, it will ask which packages you want. Choose the default option &quot;All&quot;:</p><img alt="Screenshot: Cygwin Setup" src="/assets/images/cygwin-6-99fce814e1395c8a33c78e3c5a47718a.png" width="400px"><p>The installer will now start downloading and installing the programs:</p><img alt="Screenshot: Cygwin Setup" src="/assets/images/cygwin-7-12d4c00e0534c45cbfa33c0243730157.png" width="400px"><p>Once Cygwin has finished installing, you will have a link to open Cygwin available on the desktop and start menu.</p><p>You can use this link to start using the &quot;Bash&quot; shell, or if you prefer you can open the &quot;Command Prompt&quot; as described in <a href="#Opening-The-Shell">Opening the Shell</a> and run the <code>bash</code> program:</p><img alt="Screenshot: Cygwin Setup" src="/assets/images/cygwin-8-68d2071d9e5ad3122291f85c3c977252.png" width="400px"><p>Note that you shouldn&#x27;t use the <code>--norc</code> option. I have used it in the screenshot above just so that my Bash looks like it would after a clean install, without my own customisations added.</p><p>At this point you have a ready-to-go bash environment and can continue on to the <a href="#Summary">Summary</a> and <a href="/transitioning-to-the-shell/navigating-your-system/navigating-your-system">Next Section</a>.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="option-2-use-a-virtual-machine">Option 2: Use a Virtual Machine<a class="hash-link" href="#option-2-use-a-virtual-machine" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>We can run a virtual machine on Windows which will give us a complete Linux environment. This is an ideal way to create a safe sandbox for experimentation, without changing how the rest of the system is setup.</p><p>There are many ways to run a virtual machine on Windows. For this example we&#x27;ll use the free &#x27;Oracle VirtualBox&#x27; tool. VirtualBox will run a virtual machine, and on that virtual machine we will install the popular <a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubuntu</a> distribution of Linux.</p><p>First, start downloading Ubuntu, which might take some time as the download is quite large. You will want to install the latest Desktop Edition (which at the time of writing is version 18):</p><img alt="Screenshot: Ubuntu Download" src="/assets/images/ubuntu-1-32da6aea9163bf8c0634b03e58690f08.png" width="400px"><p>While the Ubuntu software downloads, we can install VirtualBox. Go to the <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VirtualBox Website</a> and download the VirtualBox installer. You will need the installer for &#x27;Windows Hosts&#x27;.</p><p>Once the installer has downloaded, run it to start the installation:</p><img alt="Screenshot: VirtualBox Setup" src="/assets/images/virtualbox-1-b55e8eca96f9ad58a2d2b4b07c10d7f7.png" width="400px"><p>Next you will be asked to configure the installation options. The defaults will be fine for most users:</p><img alt="Screenshot: VirtualBox Setup" src="/assets/images/virtualbox-2-56e9a56597638f636bb037cfecc9e979.png" width="400px"><img alt="Screenshot: VirtualBox Setup" src="/assets/images/virtualbox-3-8b9a8364c7a91467f0c3dbb792cb8fe3.png" width="400px"><p>Then the installation will start:</p><img alt="Screenshot: VirtualBox Setup" src="/assets/images/virtualbox-4-8937d9eb77a0f58c4e04887fbe21c903.png" width="400px"><p>Once the installation is complete and the Ubuntu installer has downloaded we can move onto the next step.</p><p>Open VirtualBox and choose &#x27;New&#x27; to create a new Virtual Machine. Ensure &quot;Expert Mode&quot; is selected. Provide a name for the machine and choose &quot;Linux&quot; as the type and &quot;Ubuntu_64&quot; as the version type. Everything else can be left as the default, unless you want to tweak the machine settings:</p><img alt="Screenshot: Ubuntu Installation" src="/assets/images/setup-ubuntu-1-41d6240f93fa7636937af9f31124bc68.png" width="800px"><p>You will be asked to setup a virtual hard disk. I would recommend the default options for most users:</p><img alt="Screenshot: Ubuntu Installation" src="/assets/images/setup-ubuntu-2-ee5741a5bb4d4faa4b0f7e9d6f23ffd7.png" width="800px"><p>Once the machine has been created it will be shown in the main VirtualBox window. Select the machine and choose &quot;Start&quot;:</p><img alt="Screenshot: Ubuntu Installation" src="/assets/images/setup-ubuntu-3-4e91f8a9fb849a66312fecb62b4b9bea.png" width="800px"><p>When the machine starts up it will ask you for a &quot;Startup Disk&quot;. This is the disk which will be used to setup the operating system. Press the &quot;browse&quot; icon, then choose &quot;open&quot; and select the Ubuntu file which you downloaded, which should end in <code>.iso</code>:</p><img alt="Screenshot: Ubuntu Installation" src="/assets/images/setup-ubuntu-4-35bf528013ee3bef60ab7c3671c0bf45.png" width="800px"><p>If this step fails, you may need to disable &quot;Hyper-V&quot; and &quot;Windows Sandbox&quot; by going to &quot;Add or Remove Windows features&quot;:</p><img alt="Screenshot: Ubuntu Installation" src="/assets/images/setup-ubuntu-5-683a093ee97c0e298d809e1b68f07b0e.png" width="400px"><p>After a short while you will see the Ubuntu installer start up. Choose the &quot;Install Ubuntu&quot; option:</p><img alt="Screenshot: Ubuntu Installation" src="/assets/images/setup-ubuntu-6-503dda8507f6f47c965e34a09f267fe0.png" width="800px"><p>You can specify language settings, what components are installed and more. These options can be left at the default. On the final page, choose the &quot;Erase disk and install Ubuntu&quot; option:</p><img alt="Screenshot: Ubuntu Installation" src="/assets/images/setup-ubuntu-7-8222d073de6fd7cd0f5379564f46b456.png" width="800px"><p>The final step will be to choose a name for the computer, and a username and password to log in with. You can use any values you like here, just don&#x27;t forget them!</p><img alt="Screenshot: Ubuntu Installation" src="/assets/images/setup-ubuntu-8-4ae6fe35c79a7737ae8edf0232a8552e.png" width="800px"><p>After this the installation will proceed. It might take a little while. After the installation is complete, you will need to restart. If you get an error saying &quot;Please remove installation medium&quot; just power off the machine and restart it. After restarting you can log into the machine with the credentials you specified earlier.</p><p>When you have logged in, press the applications icon on the bottom-left of the screen and search for the &quot;Terminal&quot; application:</p><img alt="Screenshot: Ubuntu Installation" src="/assets/images/setup-ubuntu-9-463d9fdcd9eb20b6b7c9a81fdd0375ba.png" width="800px"><p>You are now running the &quot;Bash&quot; shell in the terminal. You can run the <code>whoami</code> command to show the current user, or <code>bash --version</code> to see the version of Bash which is installed:</p><img alt="Screenshot: Ubuntu Installation" src="/assets/images/setup-ubuntu-11-95ad07511fb360ee6ad0e8d977c85cfb.png" width="800px"><p>That&#x27;s it! You now have a virtual machine running Ubuntu and Bash which you can use to learn about the shell.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="option-3-setup-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux">Option 3: Setup the Windows Subsystem for Linux<a class="hash-link" href="#option-3-setup-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>The Windows Subsystem for Linux is a relatively new set of features for Microsoft Windows. It allows users to install a Linux distribution on their Windows machine. This is a great way for us to be able to use the &quot;Bash&quot; shell without having to set up a virtual machine.</p><p>First, open up the &quot;Turn Windows Features on or off&quot; option from the control panel:</p><img alt="Screenshot: Turn Windows Features on or off" src="/assets/images/setup-wsl-1-dc11f93fb578549b24b935c4182b7ab6.png" width="800px"><p>Then enable the &quot;Windows Subsystem for Linux&quot; feature:</p><img alt="Screenshot: Enable Windows Subsystem for Linux" src="/assets/images/setup-wsl-2-76bac1a1fc1a859ecfa64924141b48d9.png" width="800px"><p>After your computer has restarted, open up the Windows App Store and search for &quot;Ubuntu&quot;:</p><img alt="Screenshot: Ubuntu on App Store" src="/assets/images/setup-wsl-3-f12276a493809ef2fec57c99ede1d8a7.png" width="800px"><p>Once Ubuntu has installed, open up the app. It will then initialise (which can take a little while):</p><img alt="Screenshot: Initialise Ubuntu" src="/assets/images/setup-wsl-4-9134675242a163fce181afc99b1c68c7.png" width="800px"><p>Choose a username and password to complete the setup:</p><img alt="Screenshot: Choose Username and Password" src="/assets/images/setup-wsl-5-9687c657fd3f8d6c01bcc193b4d57918.png" width="800px"><p>And that&#x27;s it! You can now open the Ubuntu app at any time to use Ubuntu on Windows, interfacing using the Bash shell.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="macos-1">MacOS<a class="hash-link" href="#macos-1" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>If you are running a Mac, then you can probably run the standard Terminal program and follow the material in this book without making any changes. However, the version of <em>Bash</em> which comes installed by default on MacOS is version 3, which is a little out of date. I would strongly suggest that you upgrade the default installation. On MacOS Catalina, the default shell has changed to <em>Z Shell</em> - this should work fine for all of the examples in this book, but you might want to switch it to Bash to be on the safe side (you can always change back later).</p><p>To install the right software, we&#x27;ll use a tool called <em>Homebrew</em>. Homebrew is a &#x27;package manager&#x27;, a tool used to install software on your computer, from the shell. It&#x27;s kind of like the App Store but for shell users!</p><p>First, follow the instructions online to install <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homebrew</a>:</p><img alt="Screenshot: OSX Installation" src="/assets/images/setup-osx-1-4fc7d2ebdf8a24d89935281dad1f0c07.png" width="800px"><p>In most cases, this will require opening the terminal programming and running a snippet which looks like this:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_J+bg language-sh theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_csEI sh"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-sh codeBlock_rtdJ thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_1zSZ"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">/usr/bin/ruby -e &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)&quot;</span><br></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_M3SB clean-btn">Copy</button></div></div><p>However, this might have changed since the time of writing so do <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check the website</a> to see what the latest instructions are. You don&#x27;t actually need to know what is going on with this command (but by the time you&#x27;ve worked through a bit more of this book it will make sense!), but in a nutshell it runs a basic installation script, using the <em>Ruby</em> programming language (which comes pre-installed on MacOS).</p><p>Once this has installed, install Bash by running the following command in the shell:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_J+bg language-sh theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_csEI sh"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-sh codeBlock_rtdJ thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_1zSZ"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">brew install bash</span><br></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_M3SB clean-btn">Copy</button></div></div><p>This uses the <code>brew</code> command, which we have just installed, to install the <code>bash</code> program.</p><p>Finally, update the Terminal preferences to use the version of Bash you have just installed, rather than the default, by setting the shell location to <code>/usr/local/bin/bash</code>:</p><img alt="Screenshot: OSX Installation" src="/assets/images/setup-osx-2-4d3098e3ad33dc2dce7788de368e6cf6.png" width="800px"><p>Again, why we make these changes is not essential to know for now, we&#x27;ll go into more details in a later section. Once you&#x27;ve made this change, whenever you open a new <code>terminal</code> window, it will run the latest version of Bash, which you can confirm by running <code>echo $BASH_VERSION</code>:</p><img alt="Screenshot: OSX Installation" src="/assets/images/setup-osx-3-93e47b2eafb69b28b7e912d73366a70e.png" width="800px"><p>There is actually a more sophisticated way to change what shell is used in a system, which is the special <code>chsh</code> command (short for &quot;change shell&quot;). We&#x27;ll see this in a later section.

We&#x27;re not going to go into lots of detail, there&#x27;s plenty of that later on in book. Instead we&#x27;ll do a quick crash course on the basics. If you have not used the shell before this&#x27;ll give you a chance to see how it works.</p><p>Start by opening your shell. This is covered in <a href="#Opening-The-Shell">Opening the Shell</a>. Your shell should be <em>Bash</em> - if this doesn&#x27;t sound familiar, then make sure you have followed the instructions in <a href="#Configuring-The-Shell">Configuring the Shell</a>.</p><p>You should see your terminal program running your shell. You can see what the <em>version</em> is of your shell by running:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_J+bg language-sh theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_csEI sh"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-sh codeBlock_rtdJ thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_1zSZ"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">bash --version</span><br></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_M3SB clean-btn">Copy</button></div></div><p><img alt="Screenshot: Bash Version" src="/assets/images/bash-version-14d5b16e4a01db7b421bc9128a1f35e3.png"></p><p>Let&#x27;s quickly dissect this. We have run the <code>bash</code> <em>command</em>. A command can be a program on your computer, or it can be something built into the shell. We&#x27;ll look at this in a lot more detail later, but for now it&#x27;s important to understand that a lot of what you will be doing is running commands.</p><p>The <code>--version</code> text is a <em>parameter</em>. Parameters affect how commands work. This is actually easier to see with an example.</p><p>Let&#x27;s move to the <em>home</em> folder. On most computers your home folder is your personal space where things like documents, photos, music, downloads and so on are kept.</p><p>Let&#x27;s switch to the home folder by running the following command:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_J+bg language-sh theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_csEI sh"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-sh codeBlock_rtdJ thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_1zSZ"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">cd ~</span><br></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_M3SB clean-btn">Copy</button></div></div><p>Once you&#x27;ve done that, run the <code>pwd</code> command:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_J+bg language-sh theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_csEI sh"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-sh codeBlock_rtdJ thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_1zSZ"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">pwd</span><br></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_M3SB clean-btn">Copy</button></div></div><p><img alt="Screenshot: Moving to the home directory" src="/assets/images/moving-to-home-164dc619f0084c7e1ba79cd1b6486e89.png"></p><p>So what has happened here? The first command:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_J+bg language-sh theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_csEI sh"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-sh codeBlock_rtdJ thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_1zSZ"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">cd ~</span><br></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_M3SB clean-btn">Copy</button></div></div><p>Is used to <em>change directory</em> - that&#x27;s what <code>cd</code> stands for. The <em>parameter</em> we passed to <code>cd</code> was just the &#x27;tilde&#x27; character (<code>~</code>). This character has a special meaning in the shell - it means &quot;the current user&#x27;s home directory&quot;.</p><p>Finally, we ran the <code>pwd</code> command. This command is short for <em>print working directory</em>. It writes out to the screen <em>where</em> you currently are. On my Mac, my home directory is located at <code>/Users/dwmkerr</code>, which is what the command has shown me.</p><p>Let&#x27;s take another look at a command. Run the following in your shell:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_J+bg language-sh theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_csEI sh"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-sh codeBlock_rtdJ thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_1zSZ"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">ls</span><br></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_M3SB clean-btn">Copy</button></div></div><p>The <code>ls</code> command is short for <em>list directory contents</em> - it shows you everything that is in the current directory. On my computer you can see things like the &#x27;Downloads&#x27;, &#x27;Music&#x27; and &#x27;Pictures&#x27; folders, which are set up by default on a Mac, as well as some of my own folders.</p><p><img alt="Screenshot: List directory contents" src="/assets/images/ls-df7bd66eeae98e04b0422d10ccd6cb68.png"></p><p>We can pass different parameters to <code>ls</code>. The main parameter is the location of the folder we&#x27;d like to list the contents of. So if we wanted to see what was in the <code>Music</code> folder, we&#x27;d just run:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_J+bg language-sh theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_csEI sh"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-sh codeBlock_rtdJ thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_1zSZ"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">ls Music</span><br></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_M3SB clean-btn">Copy</button></div></div><p>Not much to see here:</p><p><img alt="Screenshot: List the contents of the Music directory" src="/assets/images/ls-music-8dfbb67185c5a33fb2f3fd8d2c6d8baa.png"></p><p>Many commands actually allow us to pass multiple parameters. For example, we could list the contents of my Movies and my personal applications:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_J+bg language-sh theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_csEI sh"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-sh codeBlock_rtdJ thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_1zSZ"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">ls Movies Applications</span><br></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_M3SB clean-btn">Copy</button></div></div><p><img alt="Screenshot: List the contents of the Movies and Applications directory" src="/assets/images/ls-movies-apps-5f10acf5a3b015e153365771d99caf13.png"></p><p>There&#x27;s not much in either. You might wonder why <em>Applications</em> is so empty - that&#x27;s because we&#x27;re looking at the applications <em>only installed for the current user</em>, because we are in the user&#x27;s home directory. To see the applications for <em>everyone</em> we&#x27;d need to use the folder where applications are kept for <em>all</em> users.</p><p>We can do this by running <code>ls /Applications</code>:</p><p><img alt="Screenshot: List global applications" src="/assets/images/ls-applications-95adadfe6a72bee754edda918dfdcac0.png"></p><p>The trick here is that we start with a leading forward slash - this means the <code>Applications</code> folder in the <em>root</em> of the computer, not the one in my current folder.</p><p>On Windows, applications are kept in different places, but we can see some of the installed applications by running <code>ls &quot;c:\program files\&quot;</code>:</p><p><img alt="Screenshot: List applications on Windows" src="/assets/images/ls-applications-windows-1d30de599a44ee545ad631eb5c3176b9.png"></p><p>Why do we have the extra quotation marks here? If we ran the command without the quotation marks, the shell would think we were giving it <em>two</em> parameters. It would think we wanted to see the contents of the <code>c:\program</code> and <code>files</code> folders - and they don&#x27;t exist!</p><p><img alt="Screenshot: List applications on Windows incorrectly" src="/assets/images/ls-applications-windows-error-95571fda84ee478ee5678922b29fe185.png"></p><p>The error above shows what happens when we miss the quotation marks.</p><p>Now we can take a look at how a <em>flag</em> would work. A flag is a parameter which changes how a command works. Flags normally start with a hyphen. Let&#x27;s say we wanted to know the <em>size</em> of the files in the folder. We do this by using the <code>-lh</code> pass the parameter, which is short for <em>long list, human readable</em>:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_J+bg language-sh theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_csEI sh"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-sh codeBlock_rtdJ thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_1zSZ"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">ls -lh Downloads/*.jpg</span><br></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_M3SB clean-btn">Copy</button></div></div><p><img alt="Screenshot: List downloaded photos" src="/assets/images/ls-downloads-0dd8669df2ed45c5cced6b0c642b676d.png"></p><p>Now I can see all of the <code>jpg</code> files (<code>jpg</code> files are images) in my <code>Downloads</code> folder. I can see it looks like I&#x27;ve got two pictures of &quot;Mardi Himal&quot; (a mountain in the Himalayas) which are both 384 Kilobytes in size, as well as some other images. Blow by blow, this is what we&#x27;ve got:</p><ul><li><code>ls</code> - List the contents of a folder</li><li><code>-lh</code> - This is the <em>long list in human-readable sizes</em> parameter, which means we see how big the files are in a friendly format (like <code>911K</code> for Kilobytes, rather than showing something like <code>911012</code> which would be the number of bytes - and harder to read!)</li><li><code>Downloads/*.jpg</code> - Show the contents of the <code>Downloads</code> folder, including any files which end with <code>.jpg</code> - the <code>*</code> is a wildcard which means that we don&#x27;t mind what the filename is</li></ul><p>The <code>-lh</code> parameter is <em>shorthand</em>. Many commands offer longhand parameters (such as <code>--version</code>) as well as shorthand (such as <code>-v</code> as an alternative for <code>--version</code>). Longhand is easier to read, shorthand is faster to type.</p><p>Don&#x27;t worry - in the next section we&#x27;ll see how to look up the available parameters for a command. You don&#x27;t need to remember all of these details, only understand which part is the command and which parts are the parameters. This is just an introduction for now!</p><p>Now let&#x27;s look at one more command.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="the-echo-command">The Echo Command<a class="hash-link" href="#the-echo-command" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The &#x27;echo&#x27; command is used to write out a message in the shell. Here&#x27;s an example of how it works:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_J+bg language-sh theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_csEI sh"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-sh codeBlock_rtdJ thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_1zSZ"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">echo &quot;Hello Shell!&quot;</span><br></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_M3SB clean-btn">Copy</button></div></div><p>This command writes out the text <code>Hello Shell!</code>:</p><p><img alt="Screenshot: Echo command" src="/assets/images/echo-hello-shell-f1d92f9c20f15c0e5741c07537284d18.png"></p><p>Why would we do this? One of the most common reasons would be to <em>see</em> what the shell thinks a certain value is. For example, try this command:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_J+bg language-sh theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_csEI sh"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-sh codeBlock_rtdJ thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_1zSZ"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">echo &quot;My home directory is at: $HOME&quot;</span><br></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_M3SB clean-btn">Copy</button></div></div><p>You&#x27;ll see something like this:</p><p><img alt="Screenshot: Echo the home directory" src="/assets/images/echo-home-45ee24e5927f9a6f2845504ae08ef800.png"></p><p>The <code>$HOME</code> part of the text is called a <em>variable</em>. We can recognise variables because they start with a dollar symbol. <code>$HOME</code> is a built-in variable which holds the location of the current user&#x27;s home directory.</p><p>We&#x27;re going to see all sorts of cool things we can do with <code>echo</code> as we continue in the book!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="move-around">Move Around<a class="hash-link" href="#move-around" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>One common thing we can do in a visual file explorer is move around. We can open folders, and go &#x27;up&#x27; from the current folder. We often also see visually where we are in the folder structure with an &#x27;address bar&#x27;.</p><p>A useful reference might be the picture below:</p><p><img alt="Screenshot: Shell quick reference" src="/assets/images/shell-commands-dd4418126f860c1bb692c2bf54b827d7.png"></p><p>Here we map the shell commands to the visual interface&#x27;s equivalents:</p><ul><li><code>pwd</code> shows the current working directory - where you currently are in the file system</li><li><code>ls</code> lists the files in the current directory (or any directory you tell it)</li><li><code>cd ..</code> changes the directory to another location - if you use the special <code>..</code> directory, you are telling it to change to the <em>parent</em> directory, i.e. &#x27;go up&#x27; in the file system </li></ul><p>As a final trick, lets see how we open a file or folder.  Let&#x27;s say I want to open one of the photos in my Downloads folder. Here&#x27;s how I can do it:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_J+bg language-sh theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_csEI sh"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-sh codeBlock_rtdJ thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_1zSZ"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">cd ~/Downloads</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">open himalayas.jpg</span><br></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_M3SB clean-btn">Copy</button></div></div><p>We can see the result here:</p><p><img alt="Screenshot: Open a photo" src="/assets/images/open-command-596e1bd58a6b9244a6a653f0bad118bb.png"></p><p>Running <code>open himalayas.jpg</code> has opened the photo in the application which is used for photos by default in the operating system.</p><p>Be aware -  this command is different on different operating systems (but we&#x27;re going to see later on how to fix that and make it consistent everywhere!). The <code>open</code> command will open a file on MacOS. On Windows you can use <code>start</code>, and on Linux you can generally use <code>xdg-open</code>.</p><p>As a nifty trick, trying running <code>open .</code><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>:</p><p><img alt="Screenshot: Open the current directory" src="/assets/images/open-current-directory-b657b2ed173070551c7f7301e4655876.png"></p><p>. This will open the <em>current folder</em>. Every folder contains two &#x27;special&#x27; folders. The first is <code>..</code>, which we&#x27;ve seen means &#x27;my parent folder&#x27; and the second is <code>.</code>, which means &#x27;myself&#x27;. Having this <code>.</code> folder is convenient, as it means we can do things like this - run a command to open the current folder.</p><p>We&#x27;re going to go into a lot more detail on how to work with files and folders, move around, but hopefully this has provided a crash course for the basics. They key <em>concepts</em> to remember, which are much more important than the individual commands we&#x27;ve see are:</p><ul><li>In the shell we run <em>commands</em></li><li>We can change how commands work by using <em>parameters</em></li><li>Some parameters just go at the end of the command - like <code>ls Downloads</code></li><li>Some parameters start with a hyphen, and change how the command behaves - these are often called &#x27;flags&#x27;. An example is <code>ls -lh</code>, which lists the files in the current folder with a human-readable file size</li></ul><p>We&#x27;ve also learned:</p><ul><li><code>cd</code> changes the current directory</li><li><code>pwd</code> prints the current directory</li><li><code>ls</code> lists the files in a directory</li><li><code>echo</code> can be used to write out text to the screen</li><li><code>open</code>, <code>start</code> and <code>xdg-open</code> can be used to open a file or folder on MacOS, Windows and Linux respectively</li></ul><p>Now we can start to get into more detail!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="summary">Summary<a class="hash-link" href="#summary" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In this section we learnt:</p><ul><li>That this book is for IT professionals, hobbyists or anyone who wants to learn more about how to work with computers</li><li>What the shell is, and why we might want to use it</li><li>How to open the shell programs for Windows, Mac and Linux which are installed by default</li><li>How to configure the shells for Windows or Mac to behave in a Linux-like way to allow us to follow on with the rest of the book</li></ul><p>We introduced the following commands:</p><ul><li><code>cd</code> - which <em>changes directory</em></li><li><code>pwd</code> - which <em>prints the current working directory</em></li><li><code>ls</code> - which <em>lists</em> the contents of a directory</li><li><code>echo</code> - which writes text to the screen</li><li><code>open</code> - which will open a file or folder</li></ul><p>We also briefly introduced <em>variables</em>, which are special values which start with the dollar symbol, such as <code>$HOME</code> which stores the user&#x27;s home directory. We saw that each directory contains two special directories - <code>..</code> which represents the <em>parent directory</em>, and <code>.</code> which represents the <em>current directory</em>.</p><p>With these tasks complete we can now move onto the next section.</p><div class="footnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn-1">On Windows you might need to run <code>start .</code> and on Linux, <code>xdg-open .</code>.<a href="#fnref-1" class="footnote-backref">↩</a></li></ol></div></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/dwmkerr/dwmkerr/main/docs/01-transitioning-to-the-shell/01-getting-started/index.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_mS5F" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_mt2f"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/transitioning-to-the-shell/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Part 1 - Transitioning to the Shell</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/transitioning-to-the-shell/navigating-your-system/navigating-your-system"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Navigating Your System</div></a></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_vrFS thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#what-is-the-shell" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">What is the Shell?</a></li><li><a href="#opening-the-shell" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Opening the Shell</a><ul><li><a href="#microsoft-windows" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Microsoft Windows</a></li><li><a href="#macos" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">MacOS</a></li><li><a href="#linux--unix" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Linux / Unix</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#configuring-the-shell" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Configuring the Shell</a><ul><li><a href="#microsoft-windows-1" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Microsoft Windows</a></li><li><a href="#macos-1" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">MacOS</a></li><li><a href="#linux" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Linux</a></li><li><a href="#thats-it" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">That&#39;s It!</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#a-quick-demo-of-the-shell" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">A Quick Demo of the Shell</a><ul><li><a href="#the-echo-command" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">The Echo Command</a></li><li><a href="#move-around" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Move Around</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#summary" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Summary</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Effective Shell</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/">Home</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/effective-shell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_wgqa"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/dwmkerr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Twitter<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_wgqa"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2022 Dave Kerr.
