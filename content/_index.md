## Effective Shell

Effective Shell is a book for anyone who uses a shell regularly. Whether you are a programmer, data scientist, reliability engineer, or just an enthusiast who loves to know how computers work, this is the book for you.

Each chapter is designed to be independent, showing a technique or idea which will help make you more effective.

The first section is designed for complete newcomers; if you are an experienced user you might want to skip it.

Each section also ends with an 'interlude', which gives a little bit of historic or interesting information about the shell, you can also skip these if you want!
